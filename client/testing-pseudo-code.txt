Summary Widget Tests Acceptance Criteria
Total Monetary Amount Display:

The widget correctly reads the data from the list of transactions and calculates the total monetary amount in the bank account.
The total monetary amount is displayed in green if it is greater than a configured positive threshold.
The total monetary amount is displayed in yellow if it is lower than the positive threshold but still positive.
The total monetary amount is displayed in red if it is lower than 0.00.
Number of Invoices Created in the Last 30 Days:

The widget correctly counts and displays the number of invoices created in the last 30 days.
Data Updates:

The widget updates the total monetary amount and the number of invoices created in the last 30 days when new transactions are added or existing transactions are modified.
The widget updates the total monetary amount and the number of invoices created in the last 30 days when new invoices are created or existing invoices are edited.
Invoices Widget Tests Acceptance Criteria
Invoice Management:

Users can create a new invoice with fields: client name, creation date, unique reference number, and monetary amount.
Users can edit existing invoices, modifying fields: client name, creation date, unique reference number, and monetary amount.
The invoice status is read-only and is calculated based on the criteria provided.
Invoice Status Calculation:

An invoice is marked as PAID if there is a bank transaction for the same amount, with the same reference number, and the transaction date is later than the invoice creation date.
An invoice is marked as NOT PAID if the criteria for PAID status are not met.
Data Consistency:

Changes to invoices (creation, editing) automatically update the Summary Widget.
New invoices created should reflect in the Summary Widget's count of invoices created in the last 30 days.
Editing an invoice to meet the criteria for PAID status should update its status accordingly.
Integration and Interaction Tests
Consistent State Across Widgets:

Creating a new invoice updates the Summary Widgetâ€™s count of invoices created in the last 30 days.
Editing an invoice's monetary amount or reference number affects the invoice status and updates both the Invoices Widget and the Summary Widget accordingly.
Threshold Configuration:

The configured positive threshold is adjustable and impacts the color display logic in the Summary Widget correctly.
Changing the threshold updates the color display in real-time without requiring a page refresh.
Error Handling and Validation:

Creating or editing an invoice with invalid data (e.g., missing required fields, non-unique reference number) shows appropriate error messages.
The system prevents duplicate transactions or invoices based on the unique reference number.
Data Persistence:

Changes to transactions and invoices are persisted and reflect accurately after a page refresh or re-login.
The system accurately reads and writes transaction and invoice data from/to the backend.
Responsive Design:

The widgets are responsive and display correctly on various screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
Performance:

The widgets load and update data within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., <2 seconds for major interactions).
